CHANGELOG

This is the file for Changelogs.

Change Logs: Due on GitHub in a rolling changelog.txt file every Wednesday and Friday (May 5th, May 10th, May 12th and May 17th) 
Change logs are worth 5 points each and should be a bulleted list of all changes to your application in this version. 
Your version number should increment every Change Log entry. For example v0.0.1 -> v0.0.2 -> v0.0.3, etc. 
Please keep a tab on all significant changes to your application. 
Examples of things to include: 
● Adding classes 
● Adding functionality to the app 
● Adding screens 
● UI changes 
● Major bug fixes (ie, fixed crash on loading screen) 
● Minor bug fixes (Write as “Bug Fixes”)
