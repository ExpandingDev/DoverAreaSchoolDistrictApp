Journal Entries: Due on GitHub in a rolling journal.txt file every Friday (May 5th, May 12th, and May 19th) 
Each journal entry is worth 10 points and should catalog your experience of programming for that week.
This is NOT a change log. This is a reflection on your development experience. Some examples of what to write about include:
● What challenges did you find while programming? 
● Were there any bugs which hung up the development of your program? 
● What was your biggest success this week? 
Journal entries should be a minimum of 1-2 paragraphs with ample detail.

Fri, May 5th, 2017 (Brayden)
 On Wednesday, we begun development of the Dover Area High School app. We started by deciding which features we should include in the final application, and listing these to be developed later. After deciding on features to implement, we began to work on our respective areas of the application. My job was to develop WebViews to display pages from the Dover Area School District website in the application. On Thursday, I didn't make much progress with this, as I was still attempting to learn how the WebViews worked and how to properly implement them into an application. However, on Friday, I was able to successfully create a working WebView for the District page. There is a bug, however, in which one of the elements of the web page overlaps with itself. This will have to be fixed soon, though I may be able to do this by having the WebView fill the entire page.
