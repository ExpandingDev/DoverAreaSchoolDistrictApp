This is the file for Journal Entries.

Journal Entries: Due on GitHub in a rolling journal.txt file every Friday (May 5th, May 12th, and May 19th) 
Each journal entry is worth 10 points and should catalog your experience of programming for that week.
This is NOT a change log. This is a reflection on your development experience. Some examples of what to write about include:
● What challenges did you find while programming? 
● Were there any bugs which hung up the development of your program? 
● What was your biggest success this week? 
Journal entries should be a minimum of 1-2 paragraphs with ample detail.

For date and time stamps, please use this format: Wed, May 2nd, 2017.
