This is the file for Journal Entries.

Journal Entries: Due on GitHub in a rolling journal.txt file every Friday (May 5th, May 12th, and May 19th) 
Each journal entry is worth 10 points and should catalog your experience of programming for that week.
This is NOT a change log. This is a reflection on your development experience. Some examples of what to write about include:
● What challenges did you find while programming? 
● Were there any bugs which hung up the development of your program? 
● What was your biggest success this week? 
Journal entries should be a minimum of 1-2 paragraphs with ample detail.

For date and time stamps, please use this format: Wed, May 2nd, 2017.

 Android Projects started and CHANGELOG.txt file created. Current development team includes:
   Eamonn, Brayden, Tyler

 On Wednesday, we begun development of the Dover Area High School app. We started by deciding which features we should include in the
 final application, and listing these to be developed later. After deciding on features to implement, we began to work on our respective
 areas of the application. My job was to develop WebViews to display pages from the Dover Area School District website in the application.
 On Thursday, I didn't make much progress with this, as I was still attempting to learn how the WebViews worked and how to properly
 implement them into an application. However, on Friday, I was able to successfully create a working WebView for the District page. There
 is a bug, however, in which one of the elements of the web page overlaps with itself. This will have to be fixed soon, though I may be
 able to do this by having the WebView fill the entire page.

  As mentioned by Brayden, Wednesday was the day development started and features were handed out. I was assigend the task of creating the Calendar Activity which will then be uswed later to display the lunch menu. Currently I am still working on hooking up the controller to the view as I have created the UI, but am struggling to get Events to display on the Calendar. The biggest success so far has been getting Github up and running for all developers; I was afraid it could have gotten hairy with merge issues and setting up the build environment in IDEA, but it seems that the set up and check-out all went smoothly. Hopefully using Github will help us increase our productivity. Brayden seems to have made considerable progress in the WebViews, so his developments will be very helpful. I have already found a bug in the Calendar UI; if the user exits the Calendar Activity (it's actually a Fragment but whatever), the highlight circle will remain around their previously selected date, and another cicrle will be placed around the current date. Their previously selected date should be cleared upon entry. I will have to investigate if there is a way to reset the CalendarView when the fragment is created.

  Added in more fu ctions to Calendar to fetch iCal docs. Having some trouble getting the co nection right. I might consider usong a third party library to read in the iCal docs from the school website. Other  than that, I will also need to parse the iCal stream and turn it into event objects. i wonder how i will upset the calendar, either store it or retreive it every time

  Continued to attempt to add in functionality to data retrieval for the CalendarFragment. Brayden was able to get multiple other webviews and tabs up and running, and Eammonn was able to update the UI and import the dover eagle into the app. The iCal4J library might be the wrong library to use, but unless I find another library to use, I will continue to attempt to use it. I am having trouble getting a list of events from the parsed iCalendar, but I'm also unsure as to how the iCal specification even works, so I may need to spend some more time investigating that in order to implement iCal4J correctly.

  The DoverAreaSchoolDistrict now has a fully functioning Calendar. It pulls events from the website's iCal files and populates a ListView with color coded event bubbles with descriptions that are prepended by the name of the calendar they are pulled from. We have finished the UI, with red color and the Dover eagle icon in the navigation menu. The home/menu activity may need some cleaning up, and the app still needs an icon besides the default android logo.
  The most challenging thing since the last journal entry would be pulling and populating the events list for the calendar. I had to figure out how to use a HttpUrlConnection to retreive the iCal file, and I had to switch to the BiWeekly library to more effectively parse in and manipulate the event data. After the Event objects were created, the next obstacle was an algorithm to determine if the event end and start dates fell within the currently selected date in order to display the correct events in the EventList. The algorithm first check to see if the event's formatted start day (YYMMdd) matched the formatted day of the selected date, and if it did, that event would be added to the currentEventsList. If the previous step returned false, it would then use timestamps and check if the selected date's timestamp fell within the window of the start and end dates of the evaluated event's timestamps. This algorithm currently is very effective.
  As a development team, progress has been very streamlined thanks to Github, and our app seems to be farther ahead in features than other projects, and each team member seems to have taken up equal portions of work.
